description: Tender Buttons is the best known of Gertrude Stein's hermetic works.
  It is a small book separated into three sections - Food, Objects and Rooms each
  containing prose under subtitles. Tender Buttons is one of the great Modern experiments
  in verse. Simultaneously considered to be a masterpiece of verbal Cubism, a modernist
  triumph, a spectacular failure, a collection of confusing gibberish, and an intentional
  hoax, the book is perhaps more often written about than actually read. Divided into
  three sections- Objects, Food, and Rooms -the book contains a series of descriptions
  that defy conventional syntax.
